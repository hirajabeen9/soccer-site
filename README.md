The site includes various functionalities to showcase upcoming matches, a ticket booking system, and a countdown to major events.

4. **Event Countdown Timer:**  
   - A live countdown timer calculates and displays the time remaining until the specified event date.
   - Displays weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds, and updates every second until the event starts.
